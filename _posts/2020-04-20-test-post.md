[Project Implicit](http://projectimplicit.net/) has developed [MinnoJS](https://minnojs.github.io/) to program web studies. 
The main instrument that we use in Project Implicit is the Implicit Association Test (IAT). 
The IAT is a commonly used indirect measure of social cognition (read more about such measures [here](https://www.tau.ac.il/~baranan/imp.html)). 
If you reached this blog post, you probably know what the IAT is and you want to use it in your own study. In this blog post, I will explain how you can use our script in a Qulatrics study.
